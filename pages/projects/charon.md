## Background

The created module integrates an automated tester with the Moodle learning 
management system so that students' programming tasks can be automatically 
tested. This module also includes a convenient user interface for checking 
students' submissions and grading them. Also, the module supports setting 
multiple deadlines for different groups.

I coordinated with teachers, teacher's assistants and students who use this 
module daily, in order to create a system that is useful and usable. This 
project was created for my Bachelor's thesis and is still being maintained 
by me.
